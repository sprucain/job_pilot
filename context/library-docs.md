# Library Docs

Project-specific usage patterns for every third party library in this project. This file only covers how we use each library in this specific project — rules, patterns, and constraints specific to JobPilot.

Read the relevant section before implementing any feature that touches these libraries.

---

## Before Using Any Library

Before implementing any feature that uses a third party library:

1. **Check AGENTS.md** at the project root — it lists every skill installed for this project and how to use them. Skills contain up-to-date API documentation, usage patterns, and best practices specific to this codebase.

2. **Check if an MCP server is configured** for that library. Some tools have MCP servers that give the AI agent direct access to documentation, logs, and debugging tools. If an MCP server is available — use it before falling back to general knowledge.

3. **Read this file** for project-specific patterns that override general library knowledge.

The order of authority is:

```
MCP server (real-time docs) → Skills via AGENTS.md → This file (project rules) → General training knowledge
```

Never rely on general training knowledge alone for library APIs — they change frequently and training data may be outdated.

---

## InsForge

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed InsForge skill. If an InsForge MCP server is configured — use it. The skill/MCP will have the latest API patterns.

### Client vs Server

Two separate instances — never mix them:

```typescript
// lib/insforge-client.ts — browser context only
import { createBrowserClient } from "@insforge/sdk/ssr";

export const insforge = createBrowserClient();
```

```typescript
// lib/insforge-server.ts — server context only
import { createServerClient } from "@insforge/sdk/ssr";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

export async function createInsforgeServer() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  return createServerClient({ cookies: cookieStore });
}
```

Note: `@insforge/ssr` is not a real npm package (confirmed 404 on the registry) — the SSR helpers are subpath exports of `@insforge/sdk`: `@insforge/sdk/ssr` for `createBrowserClient`/`createServerClient`/`createAuthActions`, and `@insforge/sdk/ssr/middleware` for the `updateSession()` Proxy helper. Both client factories read `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSFORGE_URL`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_INSFORGE_ANON_KEY` from env automatically.

**Rules:**

- Browser client — Client Components, browser-side auth state, realtime subscriptions
- Server client — Server Components, API routes, Server Actions, agent functions
- Never use browser client in server context
- Never use server client in browser context

---

### Auth

```typescript
// Get current user in server context
const insforge = await createInsforgeServer();
const { data, error } = await insforge.auth.getCurrentUser();
if (!data.user) redirect("/login");
```

**OAuth in SSR mode (Google/GitHub):** the browser SDK does not auto-exchange OAuth callbacks when using `@insforge/sdk/ssr` — that auto-detection only applies to the plain, non-SSR client. Real flow:

```typescript
// actions/auth.ts — Server Action, kicks off the OAuth flow
"use server";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
import { createAuthActions } from "@insforge/sdk/ssr";

const cookieStore = await cookies();
const auth = createAuthActions({ cookies: cookieStore });
const { data } = await auth.signInWithOAuth("google", {
  redirectTo: `${origin}/callback`,
  skipBrowserRedirect: true,
});
// store data.codeVerifier in an httpOnly cookie, then:
redirect(data.url);
```

```typescript
// app/(auth)/callback/route.ts — Route Handler, NOT a page
import { createAuthActions } from "@insforge/sdk/ssr";

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const code = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get("insforge_code");
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  const codeVerifier = cookieStore.get("insforge_oauth_code_verifier")?.value;
  const auth = createAuthActions({ cookies: cookieStore });
  const { error } = await auth.exchangeOAuthCode(code!, codeVerifier);
  // exchangeOAuthCode sets the real session cookies on success
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(error ? "/login" : "/dashboard", request.url));
}
```

**Rules:**

- Never call `signInWithOAuth`/`exchangeOAuthCode` from the browser client in SSR mode — always through `createAuthActions()` in a Server Action or Route Handler
- The callback route must be a Route Handler, not a page component — there is no client-side exchange to render around
- `createAuthActions()` methods are wrapped to strip raw tokens from their return value — never try to read `accessToken`/`refreshToken` off their responses, the SDK sets cookies internally

---

### DB Queries

```typescript
// Read
const { data, error } = await insforge
  .from("jobs")
  .select("*")
  .eq("user_id", user.id)
  .order("found_at", { ascending: false });

// Insert
const { data, error } = await insforge
  .from("jobs")
  .insert({ user_id: user.id, title, company, match_score })
  .select()
  .single();

// Update
const { error } = await insforge
  .from("jobs")
  .update({ company_research: dossier })
  .eq("id", jobId)
  .eq("user_id", user.id); // always scope to user
```

**Rules:**

- Always scope queries to `user_id` — never query without user filter
- Always handle the `error` return — never assume success
- Use `.single()` when expecting exactly one row

---

### Storage

```typescript
// Upload file
const { data, error } = await insforge.storage
  .from("resumes")
  .upload(`${userId}/resume.pdf`, fileBuffer, {
    contentType: "application/pdf",
    upsert: true, // overwrites existing file
  });

// Get public URL
const { data } = insforge.storage
  .from("resumes")
  .getPublicUrl(`${userId}/resume.pdf`);

const url = data.publicUrl;
```

**Storage paths:**

- Base resume: `resumes/{user_id}/resume.pdf`

**Rules:**

- Always use `upsert: true` for base resume uploads — overwrites existing file
- Always save the public URL back to the DB after upload
- Never write files to disk — always upload buffer directly to storage

---

## Adzuna API

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed Adzuna skill. If none exists — use this file and the official Adzuna API docs.

### Job Search

```typescript
// lib/adzuna.ts
export async function searchJobs(
  jobTitle: string,
  location: string,
  country: string = "us",
): Promise<AdzunaJob[]> {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    app_id: process.env.ADZUNA_APP_ID!,
    app_key: process.env.ADZUNA_APP_KEY!,
    what: jobTitle,
    category: "it-jobs", // always filter to IT jobs
    results_per_page: "10",
    "content-type": "application/json",
  });

  // Only add where if location is provided
  if (location) {
    params.set("where", location);
  }

  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/${country}/search/1?${params}`,
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Adzuna API error: ${response.status}`);
  }

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.results || [];
}
```

### Response Shape

Each Adzuna job result contains:

```typescript
type AdzunaJob = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  company: { display_name: string };
  location: { display_name: string };
  description: string; // snippet only — not full description
  redirect_url: string; // Adzuna tracking URL → redirects to actual job
  salary_min?: number;
  salary_max?: number;
  salary_is_predicted: "0" | "1"; // "1" means salary is estimated
  contract_type?: string;
  created: string; // ISO date string
  category: { tag: string; label: string };
};
```

### Saving Jobs to DB

```typescript
// Map Adzuna result to jobs table
const jobRecord = {
  user_id: userId,
  run_id: runId,
  source: "search", // always 'search' for Adzuna jobs
  source_url: job.redirect_url,
  external_apply_url: job.redirect_url,
  title: job.title,
  company: job.company.display_name,
  location: job.location.display_name,
  salary: job.salary_min
    ? `$${Math.round(job.salary_min / 1000)}k - $${Math.round(job.salary_max! / 1000)}k`
    : null,
  job_type: job.contract_type || "fulltime",
  about_role: job.description, // Adzuna returns snippet — used as description
  match_score: scoredJob.matchScore,
  match_reason: scoredJob.matchReason,
  matched_skills: scoredJob.matchedSkills,
  missing_skills: scoredJob.missingSkills,
  found_at: new Date().toISOString(),
};
```

**Rules:**

- Always include `category=it-jobs` — never search Adzuna without this filter
- Never pass `where` if location is empty — omit the parameter entirely
- `source` is always `'search'` for Adzuna jobs — never any other value
- `salary_is_predicted: "1"` means Adzuna estimated the salary — this is normal
- Adzuna description is a snippet — GPT-4o scores from it, not a full description
- Default country to `'us'` — support `gb`, `au`, `ca` as alternatives

---

## Browserbase

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed Browserbase skill. If a Browserbase MCP server is configured — use it. The skill/MCP will have the latest session management and API patterns.

### Session Creation — Company Research

```typescript
import Browserbase from "@browserbasehq/sdk";

const bb = new Browserbase({ apiKey: process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY! });

// Single session for company research — sequential page visits
const session = await bb.sessions.create({
  projectId: process.env.BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID!,
  timeout: 120, // 2 minute session — visits 3-4 pages max
});
```

**Important — Browserbase runs independently from your Next.js server:**
Browserbase sessions run on Browserbase's cloud infrastructure, not inside your Next.js API route. The API route triggers the Browserbase session and returns a response while the session continues running independently on Browserbase's platform. Do not add `maxDuration` or any timeout configuration to Next.js API routes to accommodate Browserbase session length.

**Rules:**

- Always use single sessions — never parallel sessions (free plan limit)
- Session timeout is 120 seconds — sufficient for 3-4 page visits
- Always end sessions cleanly — call stagehand.close() when done
- Project ID always from `process.env.BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID` — never hardcode
- Browserbase client lives in `lib/browserbase.ts` — always import from there

---

## Stagehand

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed Stagehand skill. If a Stagehand MCP server is configured — use it. The skill/MCP will have the latest act() and extract() patterns.

### Initialisation

```typescript
import { Stagehand } from "@browserbasehq/stagehand";

const stagehand = new Stagehand({
  env: "BROWSERBASE",
  apiKey: process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY!,
  projectId: process.env.BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID!,
  browserbaseSessionID: session.id,
  // NOT swapped to Venice/GLM 5.2 as part of the project-wide Venice migration —
  // Stagehand takes a `modelName` string + apiKey, not an arbitrary OpenAI-compatible
  // baseURL, and whether it supports Venice at all is unverified. Feature 13 (Company
  // Research Agent) isn't built yet — confirm Stagehand/Venice compatibility before
  // building it, rather than assuming this line can just be swapped like the raw
  // `openai` SDK call sites were.
  model: { modelName: "openai/gpt-4o", apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY! },
  disablePino: true,
});

await stagehand.init();
const page = stagehand.context.activePage()!;
```

### extract()

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const result = await stagehand.extract({
  instruction:
    "Extract the company overview, main product description, and any technology mentions from this page.",
  schema: z.object({
    companyOverview: z.string().optional(),
    mainProduct: z.string().optional(),
    techMentions: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
    navLinks: z
      .array(
        z.object({
          label: z.string(),
          url: z.string(),
        }),
      )
      .optional(),
  }),
});
```

### act()

```typescript
// Always wrap in try/catch
try {
  await stagehand.act({
    action: "Click the About link in the navigation",
  });
} catch (error) {
  await logAgentError(jobId, null, error);
}
```

## Company Research Section

Replace the existing Stagehand "Company Research Pattern" section in library-docs.md with this:

---

### Company Research Pattern

Three-step process: homepage extraction → sub-page extraction → GPT-4o synthesis.
Job description and user profile come from DB — never re-fetch what you already have.
Browser's only job is the company website.

```typescript
// Step 1 — Homepage extraction
const homepageData = await stagehand.extract({
  instruction:
    "This is a company's homepage. Capture what the company actually does, who it's for, and any concrete signals (funding, customers, scale, mission, recent launches). Then find the internal links most worth visiting to research them as an employer.",
  schema: z.object({
    oneLiner: z.string().describe("What the company does in one sentence"),
    productSummary: z
      .string()
      .describe("What they build/sell and who it's for"),
    signals: z
      .array(z.string())
      .describe("Funding, notable customers, scale, mission, recent news"),
    pageLinks: z
      .array(
        z.object({
          url: z.string(),
          kind: z.enum([
            "about",
            "careers",
            "blog",
            "engineering",
            "product",
            "team",
            "other",
          ]),
        }),
      )
      .describe("Internal links worth visiting"),
  }),
});

// If oneLiner and productSummary are empty — wrong site or parked domain
// Skip to synthesis with job description and profile only
if (!homepageData.oneLiner && !homepageData.productSummary) {
  await stagehand.close();
  // proceed to synthesis with empty companyResearch
}

// Step 2 — Sub-page extraction (max 3, prefer about/blog/engineering/product over careers)
const subPageData = await stagehand.extract({
  instruction:
    "Extract substance that helps a candidate understand this company before applying: what they do, their values and how they work, the specific technologies and tools they use, notable projects or customers, and how the team operates. Ignore nav, footers, cookie banners, and generic marketing copy.",
  schema: z.object({
    keyPoints: z.array(z.string()),
    technologies: z
      .array(z.string())
      .describe("Specific languages, frameworks, tools, platforms"),
    valuesOrCulture: z
      .array(z.string())
      .describe("Stated values, working style, team norms"),
    notable: z
      .array(z.string())
      .describe("Customers, funding, scale, projects, awards"),
  }),
});

// Step 3 — GPT-4o synthesis (after browser closes)
// Feed three data sources: company research + job from DB + profile from DB
const systemPrompt = `You are a sharp career strategist preparing a candidate to apply for a specific role. You are given (a) research collected from the company's own website, (b) the job posting, and (c) the candidate's profile. Produce a concise, concrete briefing that gives this specific candidate an edge for this specific role.

Rules:
- Ground every company claim in the provided research or job posting. Never invent funding, customers, headcount, or facts. If research was thin, infer carefully from the job posting and say what's inferred.
- Be specific to THIS candidate. Connect their actual skills and past work to this company's stack, product, and values. No generic advice that would apply to anyone.
- Turn the candidate's missing skills into a strategy: how to frame the gap honestly and what adjacent experience to lean on.
- Talking points and questions must reference real things from the research, the kind of detail that signals the candidate did their homework.
- Keep every item tight: one or two sentences. No fluff.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this shape:
{
  "companyOverview": string,
  "techStack": string[],
  "culture": string[],
  "whyThisRole": string,
  "yourEdge": string[],
  "gapsToAddress": string[],
  "smartQuestions": string[],
  "interviewPrep": string[],
  "sources": string[]
}`;

const userPrompt = `COMPANY RESEARCH (from their website):
${JSON.stringify(companyResearch)}

JOB POSTING:
Title: ${job.title}
Company: ${job.company}
Description: ${job.description}
Matched skills (already computed): ${job.matched_skills.join(", ")}
Missing skills (already computed): ${job.missing_skills.join(", ")}

CANDIDATE PROFILE:
Current title: ${profile.current_title}
Experience: ${profile.years_experience} years, level ${profile.experience_level}
Skills: ${profile.skills.join(", ")}
Work history: ${JSON.stringify(profile.work_experience)}`;

const response = await getVeniceClient().chat.completions.create({
  model: AI_MODEL,
  response_format: { type: "json_object" },
  temperature: 0.4,
  // @ts-expect-error Venice-specific extension, not in the OpenAI SDK's types
  venice_parameters: { disable_thinking: true },
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
    { role: "user", content: userPrompt },
  ],
});
```

**Dossier fields:**

| Field           | Type     | Purpose                                             |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| companyOverview | string   | What the company does                               |
| techStack       | string[] | Technologies they use                               |
| culture         | string[] | Values and working style                            |
| whyThisRole     | string   | Why this role exists                                |
| yourEdge        | string[] | Specific links between THIS candidate and this role |
| gapsToAddress   | string[] | Missing skills reframed as strategy                 |
| smartQuestions  | string[] | Questions that show real research                   |
| interviewPrep   | string[] | Topics to prepare for this role                     |
| sources         | string[] | Pages the company info came from                    |

**Rules:**

- Always use `extract()` with a Zod schema — never parse raw HTML or use regex
- Always wrap every `act()` and `extract()` in try/catch
- Always call `await stagehand.close()` when done — ends the Browserbase session
- Model is always `gpt-4o` — never use other models
- Temperature is `0.4` for synthesis — grounded but flexible enough to make real connections
- Max 3 sub-pages — never exceed this on free plan
- Always close session in finally block — never leave sessions open even if research fails
- Job description and profile always come from DB — never re-fetch via browser
- If browser research returns empty — still run synthesis with job + profile only
- yourEdge, gapsToAddress, and smartQuestions are the most valuable fields — never skip them

## Venice AI (GLM 5.2)

**Check first:** No Venice AI skill or MCP server is installed for this project — refer to https://docs.venice.ai and this section. Venice is OpenAI-compatible, so the `openai` npm SDK is used unmodified, just pointed at Venice's base URL.

Client is centralized in `lib/venice-client.ts` — never construct a raw `new OpenAI(...)` at a call site, always import `getVeniceClient()` and `AI_MODEL` from there so the base URL, key, and model name can never drift between call sites.

```typescript
// lib/venice-client.ts
import OpenAI from "openai";

export const AI_MODEL = "zai-org-glm-5-2";

let veniceClient: OpenAI | null = null;

export function getVeniceClient(): OpenAI {
  if (!veniceClient) {
    veniceClient = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: process.env.VENICE_API_KEY!,
      baseURL: "https://api.venice.ai/api/v1",
    });
  }
  return veniceClient;
}
```

### Structured JSON Response

```typescript
import { getVeniceClient, AI_MODEL } from "@/lib/venice-client";

const openai = getVeniceClient();

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: AI_MODEL,
  response_format: { type: "json_object" },
  temperature: 0.3,
  // @ts-expect-error Venice-specific extension, not in the OpenAI SDK's types
  venice_parameters: { disable_thinking: true },
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a job matching assistant. Return only valid JSON.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `Your prompt here`,
    },
  ],
});

const result = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content!);
```

**GLM 5.2 is a reasoning model — always pass `venice_parameters: { disable_thinking: true }`:**

Confirmed by live testing during setup: without it, the model returns a separate `reasoning_content` field and spends completion tokens on invisible chain-of-thought before it writes `content` — at low `max_tokens` (e.g. 10) the reasoning consumed the entire budget and `content` came back as an empty string, which would silently break every `JSON.parse()` call site in this project. With `disable_thinking: true`, `reasoning_content` is `null`, no tokens are spent on it, and `content` reliably holds the full JSON response within the existing max-token budgets below. Every call in this project uses this flag — none of our use cases (matching, extraction, synthesis, generation) need a visible reasoning trace.

**Temperature settings:**

- `0.3` — matching, scoring, extraction, research synthesis — deterministic results
- `0.7` — resume generation — natural variation

**Max tokens:**

- Job matching + scoring: `300`
- Company research synthesis: `800`
- Resume generation: `1000`
- Profile extraction from resume: `800`

**Rules:**

- Model string is always `AI_MODEL` from `lib/venice-client.ts` (currently `zai-org-glm-5-2`) — never hardcode a model string at the call site
- Always set `venice_parameters: { disable_thinking: true }` — see reasoning-model note above
- Always use `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }` for structured data
- Always parse `response.choices[0].message.content` as string — even with json_object it returns a string
- Always validate parsed JSON before using — wrap in try/catch
- Match threshold is always `MATCH_THRESHOLD` from `lib/utils.ts` — never hardcode 70
- Company research synthesis must always return a complete dossier — never return empty even if browser research failed

## PostHog

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed PostHog skill. If a PostHog MCP server is configured — use it. The skill/MCP will have the latest client and server patterns.

**Note:** This project runs Next.js 16.3.4 (15.3+), which introduced the `instrumentation-client.ts` file convention — the correct place for client-side PostHog init. It is auto-loaded by Next.js; never import it manually in `app/layout.tsx`, and never combine it with a `PostHogProvider` component (both would double-initialize the client).

### Client Setup (Browser)

```typescript
// instrumentation-client.ts (project root — NOT lib/posthog-client.ts)
import posthog from "posthog-js";

const token = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN;
const host = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST;

if (!token) {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
    console.error(
      "NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN variable required by PostHog is missing or un-configured, " +
        "this causes events to be silently missed. This error stops appearing once NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN is configured",
    );
  }
} else {
  posthog.init(token, {
    api_host: "/ingest", // routed through next.config.ts rewrites to avoid ad blockers
    ui_host: host,
    defaults: "2026-01-30",
    capture_exceptions: true,
    debug: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
  });
}

// Capture event client-side
posthog.capture("job_found", {
  userId,
  source: "search",
  matchScore: score,
});
```

`next.config.ts` needs matching rewrites so `/ingest/*` reaches PostHog's actual ingestion/asset hosts (region-specific — this project uses `eu.i.posthog.com` / `eu-assets.i.posthog.com` to match the EU-hosted project).

### Server Setup

```typescript
// lib/posthog-server.ts
import { PostHog } from "posthog-node";

let posthogClient: PostHog | null = null;

export function getPostHogClient(): PostHog {
  const token = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN;
  const host = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST;
  // ... missing-token guard (see actual file) returns a no-op-safe client instead of throwing
  if (!posthogClient) {
    posthogClient = new PostHog(token!, {
      host: host ?? "https://eu.i.posthog.com",
      flushAt: 1, // send immediately
      flushInterval: 0, // no batching — Next.js functions are short-lived
      enableExceptionAutocapture: true,
    });
  }
  return posthogClient;
}

// Always flush after capturing — this is a shared/singleton client, so use
// flush(), not shutdown() (shutdown() tears the client down entirely)
const posthog = getPostHogClient();
posthog.capture({
  distinctId: userId,
  event: "company_researched",
  properties: { userId, jobId, company },
});
await posthog.flush(); // required — ensures the event is sent before the request ends
```

**Rules:**

- `getPostHogClient()` is a singleton (module-level, reused across requests) — always call `await posthog.flush()` after capturing, never `.shutdown()` (that would tear down the shared client for every future request in the same server instance)
- `flushAt: 1` and `flushInterval: 0` always set on server client
- Event names must match exactly the list in `code-standards.md`
- Always include `userId` as a property on every server-side event (or `distinctId: "anonymous"` pre-login, e.g. OAuth-flow-start events where no user exists yet)
- Call `posthog.identify(userId, { email })` after login — PII (email, name) goes in `identify()` person properties, never in `capture()` event properties
- Call `posthog.reset()` on logout — browser-only (`posthog-js`), cannot be called from a Server Action; needs a client-side trigger alongside whatever calls the `signOut` Server Action
- A missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN` must never break the app — fail loudly via `console.error` in development only, stay a silent no-op in production

## @react-pdf/renderer

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed react-pdf skill. PDF generation APIs can differ from general training knowledge.

### Resume PDF Generation

```typescript
import { renderToBuffer } from '@react-pdf/renderer'
import { Document, Page, Text, View, StyleSheet } from '@react-pdf/renderer'

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  page: { padding: 30, fontFamily: 'Helvetica' },
  section: { marginBottom: 10 },
  heading: { fontSize: 14, fontWeight: 'bold' },
  text: { fontSize: 10 },
})

const ResumePDF = ({ profile }: { profile: Profile }) => (
  <Document>
    <Page size="A4" style={styles.page}>
      <View style={styles.section}>
        <Text style={styles.heading}>{profile.fullName}</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>{profile.email}</Text>
      </View>
    </Page>
  </Document>
)

// Generate buffer
const buffer = await renderToBuffer(<ResumePDF profile={profile} />)

// Upload directly to InsForge Storage
await insforge.storage
  .from('resumes')
  .upload(`${userId}/resume.pdf`, buffer, {
    contentType: 'application/pdf',
    upsert: true
  })
```

**Supported CSS properties:**
Only use these — others are silently ignored:
`padding, margin, fontSize, color, fontFamily, flexDirection, alignItems, justifyContent, borderRadius, width, height, fontWeight, textAlign, lineHeight`

**Rules:**

- Server-side only — never import in client components
- Always use `renderToBuffer` — not `renderToStream` or `PDFDownloadLink`
- PDF generation only in `app/api/resume/` routes
- Generated buffer uploaded directly to InsForge Storage — never written to disk
- Always save public URL to DB after upload

## pdf-parse

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed pdf-parse skill.

**Corrected during Feature 07 (2026-09-15):** The example below used to show v1's `pdf(buffer)` default-export call — that API doesn't exist in the installed version. `pdf-parse@2.4.5` is a full rewrite: a `PDFParse` class with `getText()`/`getInfo()`/etc. methods. Confirmed by live testing during Feature 07's build.

### Extract Text from Uploaded Resume

```typescript
import { PDFParse } from "pdf-parse";

// In API route handling resume upload
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const formData = await req.formData();
  const file = formData.get("resume") as File;
  const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
  const buffer = Buffer.from(arrayBuffer);

  const parser = new PDFParse({ data: buffer });
  let extractedText: string;
  try {
    const result = await parser.getText();
    extractedText = result.text; // raw text content
  } finally {
    await parser.destroy();
  }

  // Send to Venice AI (GLM 5.2) for structured extraction
}
```

**Rules:**

- Server-side only — never import in client components
- `result.text` is raw unformatted text — GLM 5.2 handles the structure extraction
- Always call `await parser.destroy()` (in a `finally` block) to free memory, even on error
- Always handle parse errors — some PDFs are image-based and return empty text, and a malformed PDF throws `InvalidPDFException` from `parser.getText()`
- If the extracted text is empty or very short — return error to user: "Could not extract text from this PDF. Please try a different file."
- **Next.js config requirement:** add `pdf-parse` to `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts`. Without it, Turbopack bundles `pdf-parse`'s `pdfjs-dist` dependency into the Server Components bundle, which breaks the relative-path worker it tries to spin up (`Setting up fake worker failed: Cannot find module '.../pdf.worker.mjs'`) — confirmed by live testing. `serverExternalPackages` makes Next.js load it via native Node `require` instead, where the worker resolves correctly.
